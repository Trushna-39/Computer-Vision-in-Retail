        <p class="text-lg mb-6"><strong>Overview</strong>: Interactive displays in retail stores leverage computer vision technology to create engaging and responsive shopping experiences. These displays can detect and interpret customer actions, providing relevant information, promotions, and recommendations in real-time. This not only enhances customer engagement but also drives sales and improves the overall shopping experience.</p>
        
        <div class="mb-6">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-3">How It Works</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Detection and Tracking</strong>:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Customer Presence</strong>: Cameras and sensors detect when a customer approaches the display. Computer vision algorithms process the visual data to determine customer presence and position.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gesture Recognition</strong>: Advanced computer vision techniques are used to recognize customer gestures, such as pointing, waving, or picking up products. This enables the display to respond to specific actions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interaction and Engagement</strong>:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Content</strong>: The interactive display shows dynamic content based on the detected actions. For example, if a customer points at a product, the display can provide detailed information, customer reviews, and promotional offers related to that product.</li>
                        <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong>: AR technology can be integrated to allow customers to visualize products in different settings or see additional layers of information overlaid on the real world.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Personalization</strong>:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Facial Recognition</strong>: If the customer consents, facial recognition can be used to identify returning customers and personalize the content based on their previous interactions and purchase history.</li>
                        <li><strong>Behavior Analysis</strong>: The system analyzes customer behavior in real-time to tailor the content and recommendations shown on the display.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Analytics</strong>:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: The system collects data on customer interactions with the display, including which products are viewed and which actions are taken.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feedback Loop</strong>: This data is analyzed to continuously improve the content and interactions offered by the display, ensuring they remain relevant and engaging.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
