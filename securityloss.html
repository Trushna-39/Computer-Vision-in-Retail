    <p class="text-lg mb-6"><strong>Overview</strong>: Security and loss prevention are critical components of retail operations. Computer vision technologies, particularly
    facial recognition and behavior analysis, can significantly enhance these aspects by providing real-time surveillance,
    identifying potential threats, and preventing theft. These technologies improve the safety and security of both
    customers and staff while minimizing losses due to shoplifting and fraud.</p>

    <div class="mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-3">How It Works</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Facial Recognition</strong>:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Identification</strong>: High-resolution cameras capture facial images of individuals entering and moving around the store. Facial recognition
                    algorithms analyze these images to identify known shoplifters or individuals with a history of fraudulent activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Matching</strong>: The captured facial images are matched against a database of known offenders. If a match is found, the system alerts
                    security personnel for immediate action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control</strong>: In restricted areas, facial recognition can be used to ensure that only authorized personnel have access, thereby
                    preventing internal theft.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Behavior Analysis</strong>:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Suspicious Behavior Detection</strong>: Cameras equipped with behavior analysis algorithms monitor customer actions. The system looks for patterns indicative of
                    suspicious behavior, such as loitering, frequently picking up and putting down items, or unusual movements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Alerts</strong>: When the system detects behavior that matches predefined suspicious patterns, it sends real-time alerts to security
                    personnel, allowing for quick intervention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heat Maps and Anomaly Detection</strong>: Analyzing customer movements through heat maps helps identify anomalies, such as individuals spending excessive time in
                    low-traffic areas, which could indicate potential theft.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Surveillance System</strong>:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Central Monitoring</strong>: A central system integrates feeds from multiple cameras, providing a comprehensive view of the store. Security personnel
                    can monitor these feeds in real-time or review recorded footage as needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident Logging</strong>: The system logs incidents of detected suspicious behavior or facial recognition matches, creating a record for further
                    investigation and action.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
